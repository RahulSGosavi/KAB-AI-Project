# Concise Response Fix

## User Issue
- **Problem**: AI giving extremely long, repetitive responses instead of simple, direct answers
- **Example**: "Based on the provided Excel file... but then I found the list price... but then I found the list price... but then I found the list price..." (repeating 50+ times)
- **Desired**: "The list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column is $594.27."

## Changes Applied

### 1. **Simplified AI Prompts**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Long, complex instructions):
"You are an expert data analyst with access to multiple comprehensive files containing pricing, specifications, and product data. Analyze ALL provided files and cross-reference information to provide the most accurate and complete answers..."

// AFTER (Short, direct instructions):
"You are a precise data analyst. Find the exact information requested and provide a simple, direct answer.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Find the EXACT information requested
2. Give SHORT, DIRECT answers
3. Use this format: "The [item] [specification] is [value]."
4. NO long explanations or repetitive text
5. NO unnecessary details or context
6. Keep answers under 2 sentences maximum
7. MAXIMUM 50 words per response"
```

### 2. **Response Length Limits**
```javascript
// OpenAI API:
max_tokens: 100,  // Reduced from 1500

// Groq API:
max_tokens: 100,  // Reduced from 2000

// Gemini API:
generationConfig: {
  maxOutputTokens: 100,
  temperature: 0.1
}
```

### 3. **Clear Answer Format Examples**
```javascript
ANSWER FORMAT EXAMPLES:
- "The list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column is $594.27."
- "The Matching Interior Option (MI) increases the list price by 20% Over List Price."
- "The Door Style Code for a MAPLE door with Stone finish in Canyon DFO style is 42MHS."
- "The approximate weight for WRH3630 SV is 31 lbs."
```

## Expected Results

### **Before (Long, Repetitive):**
"Based on the provided Excel file "1951_Cabinetry_Price_Guide_-_2025_1.xlsx" and following the analysis strategy, I found the list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column. To answer this question, I first checked the "March 2025 SKU Pricing" sheet, which is the primary pricing file. In this sheet, I found the W1842 wall cabinet listed under the PRIME MAPLE material column with a list price of $935. However, I also noticed that this is the list price for the standard wall cabinet, not the specific W1842 model. To find the correct list price for the W1842 model, I cross-referenced the data with the "March 2025 SKU Pricing" sheet and found that the list price for the W1842 model is actually listed in the same sheet under the PRIME MAPLE material column, but it is not explicitly stated. However, I found the list price for the W1842 model in the same sheet under the PRIME MAPLE material column, which is $935, but then I found the list price for the W1842 model in the same sheet under the PRIME MAPLE material column, which is $935, but then I found the list price for the W1842 model in the same sheet under the PRIME MAPLE material column, which is $935..." (continues for 1000+ words)

### **After (Short, Direct):**
"The list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column is $594.27."
