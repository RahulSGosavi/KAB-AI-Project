</div>
```

### 4. **Enhanced File Context in Data Filtering**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const filterRelevantData = (fileContent, question) => {
  const lines = fileContent.split('\n');
  const relevantLines = [];
  const questionLower = question.toLowerCase();

// AFTER:
const filterRelevantData = (fileContent, question, fileName = '') => {
  const lines = fileContent.split('\n');
  const relevantLines = [];
  const questionLower = question.toLowerCase();
  
  // Add file context for better AI understanding
  if (fileName) {
    relevantLines.push(`=== FILE: ${fileName} ===`);
  }
```

### 5. **Enhanced Analysis Start Message**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
"Great! I've selected X file(s) for analysis: **fileNames**. What would you like to know about these files?"
