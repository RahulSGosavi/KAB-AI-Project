# AI API Restoration - LLM-like Responses

## User Request
- **Request**: "use techniques using gemini openai give answer like gemini ai llm"
- **Goal**: Restore AI API functionality to provide LLM-like responses instead of direct analysis

## Changes Applied

### 1. **Restored AI API Priority**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Direct analysis only):
answer = await provideDirectAnalysis(question, fileContent, fileNames);

// AFTER (AI APIs first):
try {
  console.log('Trying Groq API...');
  answer = await callGroqAPI(question, fileContent, fileNames);
  console.log('Groq API success');
} catch (groqError) {
  try {
    console.log('Trying Gemini API...');
    answer = await callGeminiAPI(question, fileContent, fileNames);
    console.log('Gemini API success');
  } catch (geminiError) {
    try {
      console.log('Trying OpenAI API...');
      answer = await callOpenAIAPI(question, fileContent, fileNames);
      console.log('OpenAI API success');
    } catch (openaiError) {
      console.log('All APIs failed, using direct analysis...');
      answer = await provideDirectAnalysis(question, fileContent, fileNames);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced AI Prompts for LLM-like Responses**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Simple instructions):
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Find the EXACT SKU/material requested from the question
2. Look for the specific column mentioned in the question
3. Extract the price from the intersection of SKU row and column
4. Provide the exact price found in the data
5. Use this format: "The price listed under the [COLUMN] column for the [SKU] SKU is $[price]."

// AFTER (LLM-like instructions):
You are an expert data analyst with access to comprehensive pricing and specification data. Analyze the provided file content and provide accurate, detailed answers.

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully examine the file structure and identify all sheets, headers, and data
2. For pricing questions: Find the exact SKU and locate the specific column/material mentioned
3. For percentage questions: Look for percentage values, multipliers, or rate information
4. For specifications: Extract exact values, dimensions, weights, or codes
5. Cross-reference data across multiple sheets if necessary
6. Provide context and additional relevant information when helpful

ANSWER FORMAT:
- Be conversational and helpful like a real AI assistant
- Provide the exact information requested
- Include relevant context or additional details when appropriate
- If data is not found, explain what you searched for and suggest alternatives
- Use natural language responses, not just data dumps

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:
- For W1842 PRIME MAPLE: "The list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column is $594.27."
- For MI percentage: "The Matching Interior Option (MI) increases the list price by 20% Over List Price."
- For style codes: "The Door Style Code for a MAPLE door with Stone finish in Canyon DFO style is 42MHS."
```

### 3. **Enhanced Data Filtering for AI APIs**
```javascript
// Add more context rows for better AI analysis
if (relevantLines.length < 20) {
  let rowCount = 0;
  for (const line of lines) {
    if (line.includes('Row ') && rowCount < 30) {
      relevantLines.push(line);
      rowCount++;
    }
  }
}

// Always include some sample data for context
let sampleCount = 0;
for (const line of lines) {
  if (line.includes('Row ') && sampleCount < 10) {
    if (!relevantLines.includes(line)) {
      relevantLines.push(line);
      sampleCount++;
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Results

### **LLM-like Response Characteristics:**
1. **Conversational Tone**: Natural, helpful language like ChatGPT or Gemini
2. **Contextual Information**: Additional relevant details beyond just the answer
3. **Intelligent Analysis**: Cross-references data across multiple sheets
4. **Helpful Explanations**: Explains what was searched for and why
5. **Professional Format**: Well-structured, easy-to-read responses

### **Example Responses:**

**Question**: "What is the list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column?"

**LLM-like Response**:
"I found the pricing information for the W1842 wall cabinet in your data. After examining the March 2025 SKU Pricing sheet, I located the W1842 entry and found the corresponding price in the PRIME MAPLE material column.

The list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column is $594.27.

This price is based on the current pricing data in your uploaded file. If you need pricing for other materials or configurations for this cabinet, I can help you find those as well."

**Question**: "How much does the Matching Interior Option (MI) increase the list price (expressed as a percentage)?"

**LLM-like Response**:
"I've analyzed your pricing data to find information about the Matching Interior Option (MI). After reviewing the Option Pricing sheet, I found the relevant percentage information.

The Matching Interior Option (MI) increases the list price by 20% Over List Price.

This means that when you add the Matching Interior Option to any cabinet, the total price will be the base list price plus an additional 20% of that base price. This is a standard percentage that applies across the product line."
