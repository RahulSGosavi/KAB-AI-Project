## 🎯 What's New?

### **Real AI-Powered Responses**
- ✅ Uses **OpenAI GPT-4** (most advanced model)
- ✅ Analyzes your **project context** (name, description, files)
- ✅ Provides **professional interior design insights**
- ✅ Answers questions about:
  - Dimensions and measurements
  - Materials and finishes
  - Design recommendations
  - Specifications
  - Color schemes
  - Space planning
  - And much more!

### **Smart Context Awareness**
The AI knows about:
- 📁 Your project name and description
- 📄 All uploaded files (PDFs, Excel, images)
- 🏠 Interior design best practices
- 📐 Architecture and construction standards

---

## 💡 Example Questions to Ask

### **Design Questions**
- "What color scheme would work best for this living room?"
- "Suggest furniture placement for this floor plan"
- "What materials should I use for a modern kitchen?"
- "How can I maximize natural light in this space?"

### **Technical Questions**
- "What are the standard dimensions for a master bedroom?"
- "Calculate the square footage from this floor plan"
- "What's the recommended ceiling height for this room?"
- "How many recessed lights do I need for this area?"

### **File-Specific Questions**
- "Analyze the floor plan in MSR_SPH_PINE_RIDGE.pdf"
- "What are the room dimensions in the uploaded Excel file?"
- "Review the design specifications in the document"
- "Suggest improvements based on the uploaded plans"

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User asks a question** in the Q&A tab
2. **System gathers context**:
   - Project name and description
   - List of uploaded files
   - File types and names
3. **AI processes the question** using GPT-4
4. **Intelligent response generated** (3-5 seconds)
5. **Answer displayed** with full context awareness

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### **Make API Key Permanent (Windows)**

1. **Open System Properties**:
   - Press `Win + R`
   - Type `sysdm.cpl`
   - Press Enter

2. **Go to Environment Variables**:
   - Click "Advanced" tab
   - Click "Environment Variables" button

3. **Add User Variable**:
   - Click "New" under User variables
   - Variable name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Variable value: `sk-proj-YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE`
   - Click OK

4. **Restart your terminal and Flask server**

### **Model Settings**

Current configuration in `routes/qa.py`:
```python
model="gpt-4"          # Using GPT-4 (most capable)
max_tokens=500         # Response length limit
temperature=0.7        # Creativity level (0-1)
```

**To change the model**, edit `routes/qa.py` line 51:
- `gpt-4` - Most capable, best quality (current)
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Faster, lower cost
- `gpt-4-turbo` - Balance of speed and quality

---

## 📊 Response Time

- **Average response time**: 3-5 seconds
- **Background processing**: Non-blocking
- **User feedback**: "AI is thinking..." indicator
- **Auto-refresh**: Responses appear when ready

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

### **API Key Security**
- ✅ Stored in environment variable (not in code)
- ✅ Never committed to Git
- ✅ Server-side only (not exposed to frontend)
- ✅ Protected by JWT authentication

### **Best Practices**
- 🔒 Keep your API key private
- 🔄 Rotate keys periodically
- 💰 Monitor OpenAI usage in dashboard
- 🚫 Don't share keys in public repositories

---

## 💰 Cost Estimation

### **GPT-4 Pricing (as of 2024)**
- Input: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens
- Output: ~$0.06 per 1K tokens

### **Typical Usage**
- Average question: ~200 tokens input
- Average answer: ~300 tokens output
- **Cost per Q&A**: ~$0.02-0.03

### **Monthly Estimates**
- 100 questions/month: ~$2-3
- 500 questions/month: ~$10-15
- 1000 questions/month: ~$20-30

💡 **Tip**: Switch to `gpt-3.5-turbo` for 10x cost reduction with slightly lower quality

---

## 🧪 Testing the Integration

### **Quick Test**
1. Open any project
2. Go to Q&A tab
3. Ask: "What are the key considerations for interior design?"
4. Wait for AI response
5. Should see professional, detailed answer!

### **Verify API Key**
Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY
```
Should display your API key.

### **Check Flask Logs**
Look for successful API calls in terminal:
```
GPT-4 response generated successfully
```
