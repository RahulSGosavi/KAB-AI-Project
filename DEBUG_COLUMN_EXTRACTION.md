# üîç Debug Column Extraction Issue

## Problem Identified

The system is finding W1842 but only showing "DOOR STYLES" as the available column, which means the column extraction is not working properly.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Header Extraction**
- Added better filtering for empty headers
- Added console logging to see what headers are extracted
- Added fallback extraction from data lines

### 2. **Multiple Column Name Variations**
- Now searches for: 'prime maple', 'prime', 'maple', 'prime maple price', 'prime maple list'
- Better column matching logic

### 3. **Improved Debugging**
- Added console logs to see:
  - What headers are extracted
  - What W1842 row data looks like
  - Which column is found (if any)

### 4. **Better Row Data Display**
- Shows complete row data with column names for debugging
- Maps each cell to its column name

## üîß How to Test the Fix

1. **Upload your pricing file**
2. **Open File Analysis Chat**
3. **Ask the question**: "What is the list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column?"
4. **Check the browser console** (F12) to see the debug logs:
   - "Extracted headers: [...]"
   - "W1842 search result: [...]"
   - "Available headers: [...]"

## üìä Expected Debug Output

You should see in the console:
```
Extracted headers: ["ELITE CHERRY", "SKU", "List Price*", "Approx.", "CONSTRUCTION OPTIONS", "DOOR STYLES", "PRIME MAPLE", ...]
W1842 search result: ["W1842", "594.27", "31", "9.1", ...]
Available headers: ["ELITE CHERRY", "SKU", "List Price*", "Approx.", "CONSTRUCTION OPTIONS", "DOOR STYLES", "PRIME MAPLE", ...]
Found PRIME MAPLE column: "PRIME MAPLE" at index 6
Price extraction result: 594.27
```

## üéØ Expected Answer

With the fix, you should get:
```
The list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column is $594.27.
```

## üîç If Still Not Working

If you still get the wrong answer, check the console logs and look for:
1. **Headers extracted**: Are all columns being found?
2. **W1842 row**: Is the SKU being found correctly?
3. **Column matching**: Is PRIME MAPLE column being located?

The debug information will help identify exactly where the issue is occurring.
