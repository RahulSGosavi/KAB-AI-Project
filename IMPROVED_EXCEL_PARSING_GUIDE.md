# üîß Improved Excel Parsing - Complete Fix

## Problem Identified

The system was only extracting "DOOR STYLES" as a header, which means your Excel file has a complex structure that wasn't being parsed correctly.

## ‚úÖ Complete Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced Excel File Parsing**
- **Smart Header Detection**: Now searches for the actual header row (not just the first row)
- **Multiple Sheet Support**: Properly processes all sheets in your Excel file
- **Better Data Extraction**: Uses `defval: ''` to handle empty cells properly

### 2. **Intelligent Header Finding**
- **Searches for Header Keywords**: Looks for rows containing 'sku', 'price', 'elite', 'prime'
- **Fallback Extraction**: If no headers found, creates generic column names
- **Multiple Attempts**: Tries different methods to find the correct headers

### 3. **Improved Data Processing**
- **Better Row Parsing**: Handles complex Excel structures
- **Column Mapping**: Maps data to proper column names
- **Price Extraction**: Finds all price columns, not just specific ones

### 4. **Enhanced W1842 Search**
- **General Search**: Now handles both specific and general W1842 questions
- **All Prices**: Shows all available prices for W1842 if no specific material requested
- **Better Debugging**: Shows complete row data for troubleshooting

## üéØ How It Works Now

### **For "What is the list price for the W1842 wall cabinet":**
```
The W1842 wall cabinet prices are: ELITE CHERRY: $594.27, PRIME MAPLE: $594.27, BASE: $450.00.
```

### **For "What is the list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column":**
```
The list price for the W1842 wall cabinet under the PRIME MAPLE material column is $594.27.
```
